    <h1 class="p4"style="float:left;" ><b>What can we do to slow climate change?</b></h1>
       <br><p class="p7"><b style="color:blue;float:left;">A diet rich in plant-based foods is a good choice when it comes to contributing to
    reducing climate change. In fact, it’s estimated that by reducing your consumption of
    animal protein by half, you can cut your diet’s carbon footprint by more than 40%
    Beef production alone requires 20 times more land and emits 20 times more greenhouse
    gas emissions per unit of edible protein than common plant-based proteins such as beans,
    peas and lentils.<br> The
    diet that is often fed to livestock – maize and soy – are potential sources of food in
    themselves. Meanwhile, animals require a lot of water and other resources, and some of
    the land used for livestock is the result of clearing forests.
    You don’t need to go vegetarian or vegan to make a difference. Small shifts in diet
    choices can make a huge impact globally and having a more flexible diet as a ‘flexitarian’
    can really help.</br>
    Buying local, seasonal produce is a great idea too – it cuts down on the energy used to
    transport and store your food before it hits your plate.</b>

   <p class="p10"style="margin-top:-60px;"><b style="color:purple;float:right;margin-top:-120px;">Over the last couple of years, led by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Zoom meeting has
    become a new concept reducing physical travel, but virtual working can also reduce
    carbon emissions.<br>Getting rid of your car can reduce your emissions by about a quarter of the average yearly
    emissions contributed by each person in the developed world. Choosing the most efficient
    vehicle and going electric where possible can make a big difference.
    Flying less has an even greater impact. A transatlantic round-trip by air releases about 1.6
    tonnes of CO2 – that’s almost as much as the average annual emissions of many people in
    the developing world.<br>There’s no need to become a hermit or forgo all overseas travel. Start by looking at your
    usual schedule and identifying opportunities where you can make small, regular changes
    that add up to something bigger. For example, maybe you could cycle to work once a
    week, rather than driving.</br>

        reforestation could protect from flooding by strengthening the soil and slowing flood
