    <br> <b style="padding-left:7px;"> What is climbirds ? </b> </br>
    <br><p style="padding-left:7px;"> Climbirds is a non-profit organisation made to help climate change and stop it completely. <br>We help spread awareness about the situation and what it is and how it impacts us in the form of websites, webinars and online seminars.  </br>
        And also help run charities to plant trees, clean oceans and do other things that can help slow down climate change. </p><img src="https://github.com/TeamClimateCHANGE/TeamClimateChangeSDG13/blob/main/Untitled.png?raw=true" float="right" class="img1" style="padding-right:8px;"></img>

            <br><b class="h1"style="padding-left:10px;"> Why slow down climate change? </b> </br>
            <br> <p class="h2"style="padding-left:10px;">  If we don’t take action on climate change then the earth’s atmosphere will heat up and so will the soil. 
                <br> The earth won't be able to support many species of animals and wildlife thus, they will die out. <br>This will break the delicate balance on which the earth and its ecosystem survives and thus many <br>more species will die out and human survival will decrease a lot too.</br>That is why we need to stop climate change and global warming.</br>

       <div class="content1">
       <br> <p style="padding-left:7px;">Climbirds organised Climacon in December 2019 which aimed to teach ordinary people about global warming  <br>and climate change and help them get to know ways to take action against it.</br>
        Along with this many people also had the chance to join our organisation and along with this many celebrities attended the event, too </p></br>

    <br></br>
    <p>When covid struck the world and everyone was in lockdown, we took the chance to spread once more.<br>We did online webinars that were done in schools while online schooling was going on.</br> Through these webinars we taught the coming generation about climate change and ways through which they could help. We made them realise<br>that it was up to them to ensure the stopping of climate change and the fate of our planet.</br> </p>

        <b ><i>Charitree</i></b>
        <br></br>
    
           <p>Through this charity, people could donate money ,even as little as 1 rupee, which could be
            utilised to plant trees.<br>This charity ran from 2020 to 2021 and during this time people had
            donated 2 crore rupees and 18 million trees were planted. <br>This actually helped carbon
            emissions by quite a bit, and was one our most successful operations.</br></br>
